\begin{abstract}
Accurate quantification of the the volcanic forcing from the volcanic eruptions is important for better understanding of recent climate change.
Here we use chemistry-composition climate model UM-UKCA with an interactive stratospheric chemistry and aerosol microphysics
to assess evolution of stratospheric aerosol and associated radiative forcings from the three largest tropical 
eruptions over last century: Mt Agung (March 1963), El Chichon (April 1982) and Mt. Pinatubo (June 1991). 
Aligning with the design of the Interactive Stratospheric Aerosol Model Intercomparison Project (ISA-MIP)
co-ordinated multi-model “Historical Eruption SO$_2$ Emissions Assessment”, we have 
carried out 3-member ensembles of simulations with each of upper, low and mid-point best estimates for SO$_2$ injection
for each eruption. Simulated aerosol properties of volcanic aerosol plume are evaluted against range of
observation based data sets. Overall, our model simulations suggests that comparted to previous esmtimates 
much lesser amount of SO$_2$ injection is sufficient to simulate stratospheric aerosol evolution for each of the eruption, suggesting 
much higher climate efficacy to the stratspheric SO$_2$ injection. 
Here we show that  up to 10, 7 and 6 Tg  SO$_2$ injection in the stratosphere is
enough to simulate stratospheric aerosol evolution following Mt. Pinatubo, El-Chichon and Agung eruption, respectively.

\section{Model Setup}
We use United Kingdom Chemistry Climate Model (UM-UKCA), which is combination of  
UK Met Office Unified Model (UM v8.4) general circulation model coupled
with the whole atmosphere UK Chemistry and Aerosol scheme (UKCA). 
Model has a horizontal resolution of 1.875° by 1.25° with 85 vertical 
levels from surface to about 85 km. In present configuration,  
the whole-atmosphere chemistry combines detailed 
stratospheric chemistry and simplified tropospheric chemistry schemes
 \citep{Morgenstern2009, Oconnor2014}. 


The model set-up is similar to the one used to simulate and evaluate evolution of 
Mount Pinatubo aerosol in \citep{Dhomse2014}. Briefly, stratospheric aerosol
scheme includes GLOMAP aerosol micro-physics module coupled with UKCA stratospheric
 chemistry. Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) and ozone depleting substance (ODSs) 
concentrations are from refC1 simulation recommended in  
Chemistry–Climate Model Initiative (CCMI-1; \cite{Eyring2013, Morgenstern2017})
 activity. Simulations are  performed in atmosphere-only mode, and we use CMIP6 
(Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6) recommended  sea-surface temperatures 
and sea-ice concentration that are obtained from https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/projects/cmip6/.  
Some of key updates since  Dhomse et al. (2014) are i) improved vertical and horizontal 
resolution (N96L60 vs N192L80) II) coupling between aerosol and radiation scheme \citep{Mann2015} and 
iii) inclusion of sulfuric particles to form heterogeneously on transported meteoric s
moke particle cores \citep{Brooks2017}, iv) improvements in wet and dry deposition scheme 
\citet{Marshall2018} and v) we use prescribed sulphate aerosol surface area (SAD)
 data from \cite{Arfeuille2013}. 

For each eruption, first we performed 20-year time-slice simulations for a given 
time period. First 10-year data are considered as a model spin-up.  From remaining 
10 years, we selected appropriate three initialization files (3-member ensemble)
 where model QBO phase at 50 hPa is in approximate agreement with QBO50 index from
 Climate Prediction Center (http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/data/indices/qbo.u50.index; 
last accessed 18 August 2018). Control simulations are performed without any simulations.
 For each eruption, 10-simulations are performed with different combinations of SO$_2$ amount
with fixed injection height (21-23km), as shown in Table 1.   
Due to large uncertainties about SO$_2$ injection amount for each eruption, we decided to 
perform three sensitivity simulations with minimum, mid and maximum SO$_2$ amount. For e.g. 
for Agung, simulations are performed with 6, 9 and 12 Tg. 
Hence, ~\agub indicate Mt. Agung eruption with 6 Tg SO$_2$ injection 
between 21-23 km. And \aguc and \agud  are similar to \agub but
 with 9 and 12 Tg SO$_2$ injection, respectively, whereas \agub is the
control simulation without any  emission (background conditions). 
To avoid complexities due to heterogeneous 
chemical loss, control simulations use climatological SAD values in the
stratospheric (mean 1995--2006) and rest of the simulations use time varying SAD from 
\cite{Arfeuille2013} in the stratospheric chemistry scheme.
